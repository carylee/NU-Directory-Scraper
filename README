==DESCRIPTION
The directory scraper allows you to pull phone numbers and addresses of multiple people at a time from the Northwestern University online directory.

The script is written in PHP with the intention of being web-based.

==LIMITATIONS
Because full access to the directory is only available on campus or on the NU VPN, the directory scraper will only work when it is hosted on a computer on campus or on the VPN.

==FUTURE
Soon I will transform this into a php class for greater flexibility.
